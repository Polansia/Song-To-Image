# Audio-Image-Converter

In this project, I was able to create a functioning song to image converter utilizing what i learned with API's, javascript, css, and html. It had a 25 random image selection process which can be quickly edited to add more images. I was able to add animations to the images and text using animate.css, but was not able to fix some graphical issues before the deadline. Besides that everything I was able to do fairly straight forward. Overall a large challenge for me and I'll be sure to try and add my desired features for a future date.
